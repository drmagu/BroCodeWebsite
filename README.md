# Bro Code: PHP Full Course for non-haters 

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ6vybT1HQs)  

The video is meant for beginners and covers procedural PHP exclusively.  

All code was developed using VSCODE and locally tested with XAMPP.  

This repo illustrates a limited set of the chapters in the video.  

* 21: the $_SESSION super global
* 22: the $_SERVER super global
* 23: password hashing
* 24: MySQL database - connect
* 25: MySQL database - create table
* 26: MySQL insert
* 27: MySQL queries

Instead of doing chaper 28, which deals with creating a registration form, we did a complete website called Fakebook.  
* index.php
* registration_form.php
* register.php
* login_form.php
* login.php
* home.php

To handle any 404, we redirect to index.php which also logs the user out.
